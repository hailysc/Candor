  <!--FEMINISM SECTION-->
  <h2 class = "femTitle">FEMINISM</h2>
  <li class ="femPara1">
  <strong>May 2011:</strong> Beyoncé releases the “Run The World (Girls)” music video. This video exudes female empowerment in an unapologetic bold way. The video includes imagery for example of her on a horse, which often represents strength and freedom while leading a large army of powerful women. In the lyrics, she also shouts out men for being supportive and treating women who are in power with respect, rather than jealousy over envy. </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li class = "femPara2">
  <strong>August 2014:</strong> At the 2014 VMAs she performed a medley of her songs from her self-titled Beyoncé, a number one album. A memorable part of her performance was when she sampled lines from Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. These lines covered the screen behind her. Some of the lines included: “We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller," the screen read. "We say to girls, 'You can have ambition, but not too much. You should aim to be successful, but not too successful. Otherwise, you will threaten the man.”  This performance left no doubt in the audience about her stance on the movement.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 <!--VOTING SECTION-->
    <h2 class ="votingTitle">VOTING</h2>
    <li class = "votingPara1">
  <strong>June 2020:</strong> During an acceptance speech for a Humanitarian BET award given by Michelle Obama, Beyonce dedicated the award to all the protesters around the U.S. and encouraged citizens to vote like their “life depends on it” adding “because it does” and the need to “dismantle a racist and unequal system.” She praises people for marching, using their voices, and being an agent for good stating that their ancestors would be proud and their hard work shouldn’t be put in vain, now those in this generation need to use their real power: the power to VOTE. Michelle Obama added that Beyoncé was “calling out sexism and racism when she sees it.” Through her activism and humanitarian work, it is clear that Beyoncé has always been vocal about issues surrounding the black community and has always stood for black equality.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<!--COVID SECTION-->
<h2 class="covidTitle">COVID-19</h2>
<li class="covidPara1"><strong>May 2020:</strong> Beyoncé and her mother Tina Knowles offered free testing in underprivileged predominantly black communities. The lack of awareness in communities with minorities living in them inspired them to initiate the campaign #IDIDMYPART this was in partnership with the BeyGood Foundation. This initiative encourages people of mainly brown and black communities to get tested for free. These races are the most affected as statistics show brown and black lives are dying at a faster rate. Those who went to the two locations May 8 and 9 received not only a free COVID-19 test, but also cleaning products, household items, and gift cards for grocery shopping.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li class="covidPara2"><strong>April 2020:</strong> The BeyGood foundation has donated $6 million dollars towards essential workers. The initiative details that it will provide those on the front lines with "mental health support and personal wellness care, including testing and medical services, food supplies and food deliveries, both during and after the crisis." The foundation has partnered with UCLA offering COVID-19 care packages with resources to ease stress and anxiety. Additional support will also go towards other local organizations.</li>
