  <strong>November 1970:</strong> Bowie's third studio album, "The Man Who Sold the World" is released and the cover features him in a dress sporting long hair. Additionally, he and his then wife, Angie Bowie, were known for their androgynous lifestyles. Photographs of Angie wearing a tux and David a dress raised many eyebrows. Bowie toyed with sexual ambiguity and inspired many others after him. At the time, in a largely conservative society, Bowie recieved lots of critque. Yet, these acts were merely preludes to how Bowie was about to shake up the pop culture world, helping shape the dynamic society we live in today.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li class = "lgbtPara2"><strong>January 1972:</strong> David Bowie announces that he's gay. The British Parliament had just recently dicriminalized homosexuality in 1967 and it was still considered to be a shameful secret. What made Bowie's announcement even more remarkable was the fact that he was still married to Angie Bowie as well as new father to a son, Duncan Jones. Througought the years, Bowie changed his statement on his sexuality and at times refused to answer the question. Bowie tried to convey the message of "What did it really matter?" </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li class = "lgbtPara3"><strong>July 1972:</strong> David performs on BBC's "Top of the Pops" with his arm draped over his guitarist, Mick Ronson. It may not seem like much, but back then, this simple act was considered to be rebellious and queer. It was a revolution that angered many, caused some to rethink their definitions on sexuality and gender, and gave others the courage to be truly themselves. Bowie had caught their attentions with his bright red mullet, colorful garments, and his motley crew of a band. They claim to have gotten overnight-success after this performance. In September, Bowie released a song called "John, I'm Only Dancing". It seemed to highlight a gay relationship in which the narrator reassures their partner to not worry about the girl he's simply dancing with. "John, I'm only dancing / She turns me on / But I'm only dancing".
  </li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li class = "lgbtPara4"><strong>1971 - July 1973:</strong> Until 1973, David Bowie took on the persona of Ziggy Stardust, an androgynous space alien who came to Earth to deliver messages of hope. He symbolized an extreme, sexually free rock star, used almost as a satirical tool that shone light on celebrities being worshipped. Ziggy wore outrageous makeup and camp clothing and represented freedom. To youth all around the world this icon was exactly what they needed. Ziggy's look and message empowered the LGBTQ+ community with a sense of belonging. He was breaking barriers and paving the way for a more accepting society.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li class = "lgbtPara5"><strong>April 1979:</strong> Bowie releases a song called "Boys Keep Swinging", which pokes fun at the societal expectations of masculinity. He acknowledges gender inequality with lines such as "Luck just kissed you hello, when you’re a boy…". The music video for this song also features Bowie in drag as three backup singers, which further pokes fun at masculinity.</li>

  <li class ="femPara1">
  <strong>1983:</strong> Bowie is being interviewed by VJ Mark Goodman and takes a stance against systematic racism by confronting MTV for not feautring many black artists. Bowie goes from the interviewed to the interviewer as he presses Goodman for answers as to why black artists seem to be getting ignored on the channel. Goodman attempts to justify MTV's decisions by saying "We have to try and do what we think not only New York and Los Angeles will appreciate, but also Poughkeepsie or the Midwest, pick some town in the Midwest that would be scared to death by Prince, which we’re playing, or a string of other black faces. We have to play the type of music the entire country would like." Being unsatisfied with Goodman's answer Bowie claims "I’ll tell you what maybe the Isley Brothers or Marvin Gaye means to a black 17-year-old... and surely they're part of America too". Bowie urges change and implies it's MTV's duty to integrate. You can watch the interview <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZGiVzIr8Qg">here</a>.
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li class = "femPara2"><strong>Mid-Late 70s:</strong> Bowie always made it clear that his biggest inpirations were those of Black American rock, blues, funk music. He recalls wanting to become a musician at the age of 8 after listening to Little Richard's music and cites him as a major influence. In the mid 70s, Bowie turned to R&B, soul and funk after his glam rock era. He called this music “plastic soul. In November 1975, Bowie was the second white artist to  appear on "Soul Train" showcasing his songs "Fame” and "Golden Years" while gathering a new audience. </li>

<h2 class="blmTitle">PHILANTROPY</h2>
<li class="blmPara1"><strong>1984-1985:</strong> Bowie famously participated in Live Aid by giving a performance at the London portion of the concert. Live Aid was a benefit concert held at Philadelphia and London that was broadcasted to over 2 billion people. The event was organized to raise funds to combat the Ethiopian famine crisis.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li class="blmPara2"><strong>Late 1990s:</strong> Bowie and his wife Iman participated in 7th on Sale. This was a fashion fundraiser event which benefited research into HIV/AIDS. The idea was to take a store and get all fashion giants to donate samples, photos and objects of desire to raise money and awareness to AIDS.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li class="blmPara3"><strong>2006:</strong> Bowie took to the stage with Alicia Keys to perform live in New York City to raise money for the organization that Keys co-founded, Keep A Child Alive, that works to improve the health and well-being of vulnerable children, young people, adults and families. Though, the focus is mainly on combating the impacts of HIV/AIDS.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li class="blmPara4"><strong>2016:</strong> Bowie died at the end of an 18 month struggle from cancer shortly after his 69th birthday. January proceeds from his newly released "Blackstar" album where to be donated to Cancer Research UK.</li>
