<div class="artistInformation">
    <!--LGBTQ+ SECTION-->
    <h2 class ="lgbtTitle">LGBTQ+</h2>
    <li class = "lgbtPara1">
  <strong>Jul 2018:</strong> While touring in Spain, Benito wanted to get a manicure and his nails painted. Upon arrival at a nail, they said no because he was a man. Benito then posted an Instagram calling them out stating “For real, I don't know what to think, but this is very, very unfortunate haha what year are we in? In ******* 1960? What is this? You tell me” to his millions of followers. Benito is often seen clashing against the machista, toxic masculinity that surrounds the Latinx community.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li class = "lgbtPara2"><strong>January 2019:</strong> Bad Bunny releases the music video for his song “Caro” (Expensive). This song was co-written by Ricky Martin, a well known gay icon. The music video itself includes women alongside other marginalized groups such as the LGBTQ+ community. The video features Benito getting his nails painted, Puerto Rican model Jazmyne Joy taking his place dressing in gender-fluid clothing. It also includes people of all colors, ages, and sizes strutting down a catwalk emitting total confidence for example a black man wearing fashionable clothing, a drag queen, and a young girl with down-syndrome. The video reflects as the lyrics say “¿Por qué no puedo ser así? ¿En qué te hago daño a ti? Yo solamente soy feliz” Bad Bunny through the harmonies sings that he does what simply makes him happy.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li class = "lgbtPara3"><strong>February 2020:</strong> The night of his anticipated album release YHLQMDLG, Bad Bunny performed on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon stage wearing a tee that says “MATARON A ALEXA No A Un Hombre Con Falda” (They Killed Alexa not a man with a skirt”. This tribute raises awareness to the hate crime committed in Puerto Rico resulting in the death of Alexa. When news broke of this murder, the headlines referred to Alexa as a “man in a skirt”. Benito’s message calls attention to the mistreatment of the transgender community while defending her from the press and any transphobic references.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <!--FEMINISM SECTION-->
  <h2 class = "femTitle">FEMINISM</h2>
  <ul class = "femBulletedList">
  <li class ="femPara1">
  <strong>March 2020:</strong> Bad Bunny releases the highly-anticipated music video for his hit song “Yo Perreo Sola” (I dance/twerk alone). This song quickly became the female empowerment + booty-shaking anthem! The music video is filled with feminist imagery and symbolism. Each scene in the music video is different and each color has a message behind it.
  <ul class="nestedBulletedList">
    <li>❤️Red: Consent. NO means NO.</li>
    <li>💗Pink: He utilizes the color pink stereotypically a feminine color, and flowers to convey the message that colors and objects don’t have gender</li>
    <li>💚Green: The Feminist Fight. In the background, you can see two signs that read “Ni Una Menos” (Not One Less) referring directly to femicides and “Las Mujeres Mandan”  (Women Rule).  This color also supports abortion: ‘my body my choice’.</li> 
    <li>🖤Black: Masculinity. In this scene, he is a gladiator surrounded by powerful female queens! It shows men that respecting women doesn’t make you any less of a man.</li>
    <li>💛Yellow: Diversity. In this scene, we see women of all ages and body types having fun and dancing! It promotes body positivity.</li>
  </ul>
It’s a feminist video, he implicitly says that you can dress as a ‘woman’ and there’s nothing wrong with that.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!--BLM SECTION-->
<h2 class="blmTitle">BLACK LIVES MATTER</h2>
<li class="blmPara1"><strong>June 2020:</strong> Benito decided to go radio silent after May 19. When the murder of George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protest were picking up, fans were surprised and upset to see Benito not speaking up seeing as he does not shy away from using his platform to speak out on injustices. However, weeks of silence, Benito finally spoke up in an interview with TIMES magazine. Through an email exchange, because he does not have a phone, Benito told TIMES “There are many simple but powerful ways of helping, such as teaching, educating your community, your family, your friends.” He said he will be using his resources to help the #BlackLivesMatter movement in a serious, economic and humane way.”</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li class="blmPara2"><strong>June 2020:</strong> Through his foundation, ‘Good Bunny’ Benito asked for permits from Mayor Yulin Cruz to paint huge murals reading BLACKLIVESMATTER around San Juan, PR. Mayor Cruz told ‘El Nuevo Dia’, “So they know that in Puerto Rico and San Juan, we take anti-racism seriously and with respect.” Benito however did not speak out about this project he commissioned.</li>
