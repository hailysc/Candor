  <strong>September 2010:</strong> Lady Gaga wore the iconic Meat Dress after winning her award for Video of the Year. The outfit stirred a lot of controversy as people thought it was a message against animal rights. In an interview with Ellen Degeneres she set the record straight explaining the real message behind the outfit. The raw meat dress was meant to express her anger toward the “don't ask, don’t tell” anti-lgbtq policy. This policy was instituted by the Clinton administration it entails that if you are gay in the military, you could serve as long as you stayed closeted. She told Ellen, “If we don't stand up for what we believe in and if we don't fight for our rights, pretty soon we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our own bones. This fight to repeal DADT was very prominent in her career as she consistently urged senators to organize rallies and posted content to raise awareness until it was repealed in 2011.

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li class = "lgbtPara2"><strong>July 2017:</strong> Consequently, when Trump instilled a new form of DADT, a trans military ban, she was rapid to speak up and she said “The message you have just sent has endangered the lives of people all over the United States and overseas bravely serving our nation.”
</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li class = "lgbtPara3"><strong>February 2011</strong> Lady Gaga releases her music video for “Born This Way” This song topped the Billboard Hot 100’s with pro-LGBTQ+ lyrics. Sir Elton John claimed that it was the “new gay anthem” on Entertainment Weekly. In unreleased lyrics she sings “No matter gay, straight, or bi/ Lesbian, transgender life/ I’m on the right track, baby/ I was born to survive”. The song is about self-love, self-acceptance, embracing and celebrating your queerness. The song also conveys that you could be who you want and are free to make your own decisions and people will support you instead of judge. Here she expresses that you could be loved no matter how they are or where they come from. Shortly after the success of the song, she founded the Born This Way Foundation whose focus is youth empowerment and creating a kinder and braver world.
